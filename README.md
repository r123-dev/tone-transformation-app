## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tone-transformation-app.git
   cd tone-transformation-app
Install dependencies:

For the frontend:

cd frontend
npm install

For the backend:


cd backend
npm install
Run the application:

Start the backend server:

cd backend
node index.js
The backend will be running on http://localhost:4000.

Start the frontend development server:


cd frontend
npm start
The frontend will be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Open the application in your browser.

Enter your text in the input field.

Use the slider to adjust the tone level (1-10).

Click "Transform Tone" to apply the tone transformation.

Use the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to revert or reapply previous transformations.

The transformed text will appear in the input field.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express

State Management: React state and useRef for undo/redo functionality

API: The backend interacts with a tone transformation API to adjust the tone of the input text.

Technical Architecture
For this project, I chose a simple yet efficient architecture using a React frontend with state management for real-time text transformation and a Node.js backend for tone adjustment. The main components of the system are:

Frontend: React handles the user interface, where users can input text, adjust the tone level, and interact with the undo/redo functionality.

Backend: A Node.js server with Express processes the tone adjustments by interacting with a tone-adjusting API.

This architecture allows for a clean separation of concerns: the frontend handles user interaction, while the backend processes data and returns the transformed text.

State Management (Undo/Redo Functionality)
To manage the application's state, I used React's useState for simple state variables (e.g., text, tone) and useRef for maintaining the undo and redo stacks.

For the undo/redo functionality:

Undo: Every time a new transformation is made, the current state (i.e., the text) is saved to an undo stack. The user can undo the change by popping the last saved text from the undo stack and pushing the current state to the redo stack.

Redo: Similarly, after an undo action, the previous state is pushed to the redo stack, allowing the user to redo the action by popping from the redo stack.

This approach ensures that the user can freely navigate through changes and revert to previous states without losing data.

Error Handling and Edge Cases
For error handling, I implemented a robust approach that includes:

API errors: If the backend fails to respond or the transformation fails, an error message is displayed to the user, ensuring the app remains responsive and informative.

User input: If the user enters an empty string or invalid text, the application simply doesn't proceed with the transformation and prompts them to enter valid text.

Loading state: While the tone transformation is being processed, a loading indicator is shown, ensuring the user knows the app is working on their request.

I also considered edge cases such as:

Very large texts or unsupported characters. The app ensures that any input is properly sanitized and processed efficiently.

Trade-offs
One trade-off I made was limiting the backend to a simple POST request for tone adjustments, rather than implementing more complex interactions like websockets or multiple endpoints. This was done to maintain simplicity and focus on core functionality. However, as the app grows, there could be considerations for optimizing this approach, especially for scalability.
